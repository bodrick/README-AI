| lru_test.go       | This code is a package for testing a cache, specifically an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache and a Segmented LRU (SLRU) cache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | lru_test.go       |
| policy.go         | Package cache is a data structure for storing cache entries with a cache policy. It includes functions for getting, setting, and deleting entries, as well as functions for managing the cache policy.                                                                                                                                          | policy.go         |
| cache.go          | Package cache provides partial implementations of Guava Cache, including support for LRU, Segmented LRU and TinyLFU. It provides functions to get, put, invalidate, and refresh values associated with keys, as well as a Reloader interface to asynchronously reload values.                                                                   | cache.go          |
