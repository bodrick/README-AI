## 🔮 Features

### Distinctive Features

1. **User-Centered Design:** The project focuses on the user's needs, by providing routes such as "/" and "/health" and setting the port to 8080 if one is not provided. 
2. **Dependency Management:** The project is written in Go 1.19 with various dependencies, including github.com/labstack/echo/v4 v4.10.2, jwt, gommon, bytebufferpool, fasttemplate, crypto, net, sys, text, and time. 
3. **Unit Testing:** The script main_test.go is a demonstration of unit testing a function using the Go language; it tests a function called IntMin with two input parameters and evaluates the returned result against a set of expected values included in a table. 
4. **Integration with Docker and Google Cloud Platform:** The project is designed for use with Docker and Google Cloud Platform. This enables users to take advantage of the scalability and flexibility of the cloud platform while using the powerful features of container technology.
