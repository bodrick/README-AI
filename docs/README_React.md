| AudioAnalyser.js         | This code creates an AudioAnalyser component that uses the AudioContext API to create an analyser node and connect it to a media stream source.                                                                            |
| AudioVisualiser.js       | This code creates a React component called AudioVisualiser which renders a canvas element and draws a line graph based on audio data.                                                                                      |
| index.js                 | This code imports the React and ReactDOM libraries, imports the App component from the App. js file, and renders the App component in the root element of the HTML document.                                               |
| index.css                | This code sets up a basic webpage layout with a header, main content area, and footer. The body has a font family of Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif and a background color of #333e5a.                                       |
| registerServiceWorker.js | This code registers a service worker to serve assets from local cache, allowing the app to load faster on subsequent visits and giving it offline capabilities.                                                            |
