| auth.rs          | This code provides an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer( SASL) protocol for authenticating a user with a server. It supports the mechanisms Anonymous, Plain, and Scram with SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashing algorithms. It uses the futures::stream::StreamExt, sasl::client::mechanisms     | tokio-xmpp/src/client/auth.rs          |
| mod.rs           | This code defines two modules, auth and bind, and two public modules, async_client and simple_client. The auth and bind modules provide authentication and binding functionality, while the async_client and simple_client modules provide asynchronous and simple client functionality.                             | tokio-xmpp/src/client/mod.rs           |
| simple_client.rs | This code implements a Client struct which provides a simple XMPP client connection. It implements the Stream and Sink traits from the futures crate, allowing for sending and receiving of XMPP packets. It provides methods for connecting to an XMPP server, sending stanzas, and ending the connection.          | tokio-xmpp/src/client/simple_client.rs |
| async_client.rs  | This code implements an XMPP client connection and state, allowing for the connection to be reconnected. It implements the ` futures ` crate's Stream and Sink traits, allowing for the sending and receiving of XMPP packets. It also provides methods for sending stanzas and ending the connection.               | tokio-xmpp/src/client/async_client.rs  |
| bind.rs          | This code provides a function to bind a resource to an XMPPStream, allowing the stream to be used for communication. It checks if the stream supports resource binding, and if so, sends a BindQuery and waits for a BindResponse. If the response is valid, the stream's JID is updated and the stream is returned. | tokio-xmpp/src/client/bind.rs          |

| auth.rs | This code is an async function that authenticates a XMPPStream with a given password. It sends a handshake stanza with the given password and stream ID, and then loops until it receives either a handshake accept stanza or an error stanza. If the handshake accept stanza is received, the function returns Ok, otherwise it returns | tokio-xmpp/src/component/auth.rs |
| mod.rs  | This code creates a Component struct which simplifies the XMPPStream to a Stream / Sink of Elements( stanzas). It also provides methods to connect to an XMPP server, send stanzas, and end the connection.                                                                                                                              | tokio-xmpp/src/component/mod.rs  |

It then prints out the vector of articles.                                                                                                                                                                   | minidom/examples/articles.rs            |
| hello_bot.rs        | This code is a bot written in Rust that uses the XMPP protocol. It connects to a server, joins rooms, sends messages, and retrieves avatars. It also handles events such as contacts being added, removed, or changed, as well as messages being sent or received.                                                    | xmpp/examples/hello_bot.rs              |
| echo_component.rs   | This code creates a Component instance and uses it to send and receive messages. It takes in four arguments: a JID, a password, a server, and a port. It then sends a presence message and enters a loop to process events. If a message is received, it will echo the message back.                                  | tokio-xmpp/examples/echo_component.rs   |
| send_message.rs     | This code is a program written in Rust that creates a simple XMPP client. It takes four arguments from the command line: a JID, a password, and a recipient. It then reads a message from standard input and sends it to the recipient. Finally, it closes the client connection.                                     | tokio-xmpp/examples/send_message.rs     |
| download_avatars.rs | This code is a main loop that processes events from an XMPP client. It handles incoming stanzas, such as IQs, messages, and presences, and responds accordingly. It also handles downloading avatars and saving them to a file.                                                                                       | tokio-xmpp/examples/download_avatars.rs |
| echo_bot.rs         | This code creates an XMPP client that connects to a server and echoes messages sent to it. It also has a secret command that triggers the client to disconnect from the server. It uses the futures::stream::StreamExt, std::convert::TryFrom, std::env::args, std::process::exit, tok                                | tokio-xmpp/examples/echo_bot.rs         |
